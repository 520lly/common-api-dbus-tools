== Common API Overview

Common API and its mechanism specific bindings (e.g. Common API D-Bus) provide a set of libraries and tools to work with 
RPC communication in a way independent of wich mechanism is used. It consist currently consists of four subprojects:
----
CommonAPI - This is the base C++ library, which provides the application interface for users and can 
            load runtime bindings such as dbus. 
CommonAPI-Tools - The eclipse based tools for CommonAPI. This is essentially the code generator for 
                  Franca -> Common API C++ code.
CommonAPI-D-Bus - This is the D-Bus binding C++ library, which provides the necesary code to communicate 
                  over D-Bus. This is invisible to the application code, and simply needs to be linked against.
CommonAPI-D-Bus-Tools - The eclipse based tools for CommonAPI D-Bus. This is the code generator for 
                        Franca -> Common API D-Bus C++ code.
                        (This is the current package.)
----
== Usage Instructions

The simplest way to use the CommonAPI Tools is to add the update site available on the GENIVI project servers to you Eclipse. 
This is available under:

Help->Install New Software->Add Button

Enter the following URL: http://docs.projects.genivi.org/yamaica-update-site/CommonAPI/updatesite/ and confirm. 

This provides CommonAPI, CommonAPI-D-Bus and all dependencies. 

Then select the newly added site in the site selection dropdown box, and in the Software selection window, 
select the entire "GENIVI Common API" Tree.

After the software has been installed in Eclipse you can right-click on any .fidl file and generate C++ code for CommonAPI D-Bus 
by selecting the "CommonAPI->Generate Common API D-Bus Code" option.

== Build Instructions

These are Eclipse Plug-In projects which require Xtext2 and Franca as dependencies within Eclipse. They also require the projects from the
CommonAPI-Tools sub-project to be imported in to Eclipse. 

To build first import the three projects
----
org.genivi.commonapi.dbus.
org.genivi.commonapi.dbus.ui
org.genivi.commonapi.dbus.feature
----

in to Eclipse. Then simply build the workspace. Then right-click on the .feature project and select "Run as Eclipse Application" to launch 
the built projects.

== Working on the code & contribution

.First get the code from the git:
        git clone 

.Get an overview of all branches:
        git branch

.Switch to the branch you want to work on (master is the feature branch) and verify that it has switched (* changed)
        git checkout <your branch>
        git branch

.Best practice is to create a local branch based on the current branch:
        git branch working_branch

Start working, best practice is to commit smaller, compilable pieces during the development process that makes it easier to handle later on.

.If you want to commit you changes, send them to the author, you can create a patch like this:
        git format-patch working_branch <your branch>

This creates a set of patches that are published via the mailing list.The patches will be discussed and then merged & uploaded on the git by the maintainer.

Patches can be accepted either under GENIVI Cla or MPL 2.0 (see section License). Please be sure that the signed-off-by is set correctly. For more, check out http://gerrit.googlecode.com/svn/documentation/2.0/user-signedoffby.html
