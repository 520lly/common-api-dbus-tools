Example: BlueZ
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example demonstrates how to use deployment (+.fdepl+) to access D-Bus legacy
services, here BlueZ 4, from within a CommonAPI client application.

It also demonstrates usage of +DBusAddressTranslator+ to dynamically create
proxies for services offered under a custom naming scheme. In case of BlueZ
the adapters are availble under custom object paths, e.g. "/org/bluez/787/hci0".

Running
^^^^^^^

To ensure that the configuration file (ini) is found and parsed issue following
commands to start the BlueZ example client (assuming running it from the examples
directory):

[IMPORTANT]
 export COMMONAPI_DBUS_CONFIG=./commonapi4dbus.ini +
 ./build/BlueZClient
