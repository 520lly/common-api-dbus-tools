Example: UDisks2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example demonstrates how to access D-Bus legacy services, here UDisks2 (tested with 
version 2.1.3), from within a CommonAPI client application.

As UDisk2 implements +org.freedesktop.DBus.ObjectManager+ what is covered more deeply by CommonAPI
example +E05Manager+, this example focuses on utilizing CommonAPI configuration file to: 

* access the D-Bus system bus

* determine service availability in absence of a custom interfaces in main object path, for UDisks2
  this is +/org/freedesktop/UDisks2+ by mapping a proxy with no methods etc. (+RootProxy+) to D-Bus'
  "default" org.freedesktop.Peer interface

Running
^^^^^^^

To ensure that the configuration file (ini) is found and parsed issue following
commands to start the BlueZ example client (assuming running it from the examples
directory):

[IMPORTANT]
 export COMMONAPI_DBUS_CONFIG=./commonapi4dbus.ini +
 ./build/UDisks2Client
